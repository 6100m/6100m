### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am 6100m, and I like to hack a lot of things, ranging from ARM based devices like iPhones and various Nintendo consoles, to having interest in hacking Androids and pissing myself at ridiculous chinese bootleg stuff, such as the infamous "cracked" Pokemon SNES bootlegs. I even enjoy PC hacking and exploitation in many other places, but I've recently taken interest in reverse engineering many of the networking servers and protocols Nintendo made. I used to be a WiiLink24 dev, but I have since retired, resigned, gone part-time and I am now moderating and working on XConnect24, and NewWFC. I also have strong beliefs in privacy, and I am a bit easily offended when people critcize my code a bit too much (It's not the greatest, honestly)
